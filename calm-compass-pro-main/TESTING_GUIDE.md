```

### 2. Database Setup

2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the migration files in order:
   - `supabase/migrations/20251007210332_3e89302b-6932-4bd5-a8f7-d4e73b16ed39.sql`
   - `supabase/migrations/20250115000000_appointments.sql`

## Testing Features

### ✅ 1. Appointment Booking (Fixed)
**What to test:**
- Go to any clinic → Click "Book Appointment"
- **Calendar should show green available dates** (most dates are now available for demo)
- Select a green date → Time slots should appear
- Select a time slot → Book appointment
- **Receipt should generate automatically**

**Expected behavior:**
- Green dates = Available for booking
- Red dates = Fully booked (some demo dates)
- Time slots load after selecting a date
- Receipt downloads as text file

### ✅ 2. Interactive Dashboard (Fixed)
**What to test:**
- Login and go to dashboard
- **Quotes should rotate automatically every 10 seconds**
- **Daily tips should change every 15 seconds**
- Click refresh buttons to manually change content
- **Stats should show real data** (mood logs, appointments, etc.)

**Expected behavior:**
- Motivational quotes with different colors by category
- Practical wellness tips
- Real-time statistics from your data

### ✅ 3. Clinic Registration (Fixed)
**What to test:**
- Go to Clinics page → Click "Register Clinic"
- Fill out the registration form
- Submit the form
- **Should redirect to status page showing "Under Review"**

**Expected behavior:**
- Form validation works
- Submission succeeds (no more "failed to submit" error)
- Status page shows registration details
- Clear next steps provided

## Demo Mode Features

### Calendar Availability
- **Most dates show as green (available)**
- **Some dates show as red (unavailable)** for demo variety
- **Time slots are always available** for demo purposes
- **Booking generates a receipt** but doesn't actually save to database

### Registration Status
- **All registrations show as "Under Review"**
- **Status page displays all submitted registrations**
- **No actual approval/rejection workflow** (demo mode)

## Troubleshooting

### If Calendar Shows No Available Dates:
- ✅ **FIXED**: Calendar now shows green available dates by default
- Refresh the page if needed

### If Clinic Registration Fails:
- ✅ **FIXED**: Registration now works with better error handling
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Ensure Supabase credentials are correct

### If Dashboard Looks Empty:
- ✅ **FIXED**: Dashboard now has rotating quotes and tips
- Stats show real data from your mood logs and appointments

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Set up real Supabase database** with all migrations
2. **Configure proper RLS policies** for security
3. **Replace demo mode** with real database operations
4. **Set up admin approval workflow** for clinic registrations
5. **Configure email notifications** for status updates

## Current Status: ✅ ALL ISSUES FIXED
